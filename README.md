#Project Goal
This project aims to create an accessible page for visually and hearing impaired individuals. It allows them to download a text file or paste a text to be read by the application.
It is still under construction. Therefore, only the accessibility features for visually impaired users are completed. 
The implementation of the Hand Talk plugin, a tool that allows the deaf community to access a sign language interpreter on the website, is still pending.

#Main tool
Speech Synthesis API
